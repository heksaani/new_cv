## Experience

### Bioinformatician 
[Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare](https://thl.fi/en/main-page) | 07/2025-

**Current Projects:**

- Automation of sequencing data analysis pipelines
- LIMS Database migration: Data 
- Technical testing CLI tool

**TOOLS**:
python, git, nextflow, oracle sql developer

### Master thesis project
[]() | 06/2024-10/2024

My work was in collaboration project with Ville Mustonen and Melina Markkanen to study waste water microbial methylation patterns for my master thesis.
I did analysis on methylation data and trained Random forest model to classify bacterial species from waste water samples. My work was used as part of scientific publication.

**TOOLS**:
python

### Research Assistant
[Folkhälsan reseach institute](https://research.folkhalsan.fi/genetics/eye-genetics "Eye Genetics Group") | 01/2023 - 12/2024

As a research assistant, I conducted downstream analysis of sequencing data, statical analyses and developed automated pipelines for robust, reproducible workflows. I managed large-scale data storage systems in CSC Allas. My role also involved leveraging batch processing using CSC to handle high-throughput computational tasks, such as sequence alignment of long read sequencing data and variant calling, optimizing workflows for sequencing data from multiple patients. Additionally, I collaborated with multidisciplinary team which included doctors and biologist from varying fields to integrate bioinformatics solutions into research projects in the biomedical field.

**TOOLS**:
python, slurm, csc, bash

### Software Testing
[FISION OY](https://www.fision.fi/fi/) | 09/2021-02/2022

I worked part time in a software development company as a GUI tester. The main focus of my work was on user interface testing and documentation but I was also learning about the software development of the system.
